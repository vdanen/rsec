.SH NAME
rsec - Annvix security reporting tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fPrsec\fP is a suite of scripts that handle security reporting on an
Annvix system.  Essentially, rsec is the little brother of Mandriva's
msec utility in that all rsec does is reporting; it does not change anything
on the system whatsoever.  The daily security checks you may be familiar
with from msec are what make up rsec.
.PP
The components of rsec are some shellscripts that are called via
/etc/cron.hourly and /etc/cron.daily.  rsec is a passive reporting system,
there is very little a system's administrator needs to do other than view
the reports.
.PP
The configuration file of rsec is /etc/security/rsec.conf.  The following
options can be configured.  The various options allow you to customize what
rsec reports.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.PP
Available options:
.TP
\fBCHECK_SECURITY=[yes|no]\fR
Enables or disables rsec reports completely.
.TP
\fBCHECK_UNOWNED=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking of files that are owned by uid's and gid's that are
not available on the system.
.TP
\fBCHECK_SUID_MD5=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking of md5sums for files that are installed suid.  This
report will indicate if the md5sums have changed for an suid file which may
indicate a rootkit or other tampering.
.TP
\fBCHECK_SUID_ROOT=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for new suid root files installed on the system.
.TP
\fBCHECK_SGID=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for new sgid files installed on the system.
.TP
\fBCHECK_WRITABLE=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for files that are world-writeable.
.TP
\fBWRITABLE_EXCLUDE="[dir1 dir2]"\fR
Exclude certain directories (and their sub-directories) from being included
in the world-writeable file report (this is useful for things like /dev directories
inside a chroot, etc.).  Only one statement is permitted, multiple directories can
be included in the statement, separated by a space.  If specifying more than one
directory, they must be surrounded by quotes.
.TP
\fBRPM_CHECK=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for newly installed or removed RPM packages.
.TP
\fBCHECK_OPEN_PORT=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for open and listening ports on your system.
.TP
\fBRKHUNTER_CHECK=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's invocation of rkhunter to check the system for any signs of
a rootkit being installed.
.TP
\fBSYSLOG_WARN=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's logging to syslog.  Typically, rsec logs to the
/var/log/security.log file, however with this option enabled, rsec will also
log to syslog.  This is extremely useful if you have syslog configured to
log to a remote syslog server and which to see the output of rsec's checking
on the remote syslog server.
.TP
\fBTTY_WARN=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's logging to any TTY that root is logged into.  rsec can be
configured to print it's reports to the consoles that are logged into by
root.
.TP
\fBMAIL_WARN=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's emailing of reports to either root, if \fBMAIL_USER\fR is not
set, or to whichever email address \fBMAIL_USER\fR is set to.
.TP
\fBMAIL_EMPTY_CONTENT=[yes|no]\fR
If set to yes, rsec will email reports regardless of whether they contain
anything.
.TP
\fBMAIL_USER=n\fR
By default, if configured, rsec will email reports to the system's root
user.  With this setting, you can control who receives the reports.
.TP
\fBCHECK_PERMS=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's checking for files with bad permissions; ie. files owned by
one user but in another user's home directory, and so forth.
.TP
\fBCHECK_PASSWD=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's sanity checks on /etc/passwd; ie. ensuring that all accounts
that should have passwords do have passwords.
.TP
\fBCHECK_SHADOW=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's sanity checks on /etc/shadow; ie. ensuring that all accounts
that should have passwords do have passwords.
.TP
\fBCHECK_PROMISC=[yes|no]\fR
Enables rsec's check on whether or not any ethernet cards are in promiscous
mode.  While all of the other checks are done on a daily basis, this one
check is done on an hourly basis.
.TP
\fBEXCLUDE_REGEXP=[regexp]\fR
This allows you to exclude certain directories and files from the daily reports
that rsec executes.  For instance, you could use the regexp \fI"^/tmp"\fR to exclude
the /tmp directory.  The regular expressions used are the same as what you would use
on a commandline and must be properly escaped (ie. "^/tmp\|^/mnt/chroot\|^/var/tmp/php*").
