rsec - Annvix security reporting tool
-------------------------------------


rsec is a fork of the old msec tool written for Mandriva Linux.  It was
forked from msec on March 10, 2004 for the Annvix operating system
(http://annvix.org/).  The fork was primarily due to the desire to have a
reporting tool that didn't do all of the behind-your-back changes that msec
did.  rsec only reports, it never configures or changes anything.

Written and maintained by Vincent Danen and licensed under the GPLv2.  See
AUTHORS for the original msec authors.
